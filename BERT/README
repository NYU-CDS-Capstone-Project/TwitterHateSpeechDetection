These files are intended in conjunction with https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-pretrained-BERT.
This folder contains 
(1) files that put our data in an appropriate format to be trained with Google BERT
(2) a modified version of the run_classifier.py that also outputs the f-score
(3) a bash script to run the models using our best hyperparameters.
(4) files that prepare the full dataset of tweets for prediction
(5) a file eval_classifier.py that predicts the labels for tweets and also outputs the class probability.
